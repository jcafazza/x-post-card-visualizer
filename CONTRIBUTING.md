## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git

### Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.

2. **Clone your fork:**

## Development Workflow

### Code Style

- **TypeScript**: We use strict TypeScript. All code must type-check.
- **Formatting**: Follow existing code style and patterns.
- **Imports**: Use absolute imports with `@/` prefix (configured in `tsconfig.json`).
- **Components**: Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces for props.

```

## Architecture Notes

### Key Design Decisions

- **No API Keys Required**: Uses X's public syndication endpoints
- **Stateless**: No user accounts or data storage
- **Server-Side Scraping**: Prevents CORS issues and enables reliable export
- **Image Proxy**: All images proxied through `/api/image` for same-origin loading

### Important Files

- `web/app/api/scrape-post/route.ts` - Main scraping logic
- `web/lib/themes.ts` - Theme configuration
- `web/constants/ui.ts` - Animation and UI constants
- `web/components/InteractivePostCard.tsx` - Main card component

## Questions?

If you have questions or need help:
